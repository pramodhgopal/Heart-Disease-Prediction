# Heart-Disease-Prediction
A look into some machine learning models and their performance when it comes to predicting heart disease

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, accounting for over 31% of all deaths worldwide. CVDs are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions. The most common of these disorders affecting people is heart disease. Considering how prevelant it is, identifying those at highest risk of heart disease and ensuring they receive appropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths. That is the purpose of this project. We will observe a dataset from the Kaggle website about heart disease, perform some exploratory data analysis on and try to come up with some classification models to predict people at risk of heart disease.

This repository includes the python notebook I used and the data i got from the kaggle website. link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction?datasetId=1582403
